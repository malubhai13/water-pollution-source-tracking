        <h1>Yamuna River Pollution And Sustainable Solutions For The Future</h1></CENTEr>
        <p id ="IPARA">
           
            <CENTER>Yamuna is the second largest tributary of River Ganga and the longest tributary of India, it originates from Yamunotri glacier in Uttarakhand and flows across seven states and merges with the river Ganga at Sangam in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh.
                Religious Significance: Yamuna is worshipped in Hinduism as the ‘Goddess Yamuna’ and as per Hindu mythology is the daughter of the Sun and sister of the Yama the ‘God of Death’. It is common practice for people to bathe in the sacred waters to rid oneself of sins and the last rites of the dead are also performed at its banks.
                Socioeconomic Significance: It helps create the highly fertile alluvial Yamuna- in the Indo-Gangetic plain. Nearly 57 million people depend on the Yamuna’s waters. With an annual flow of about 10,000 cubic billion metres, the river accounts for more than 70% of Delhi’s water supply.</p>

        <h1><ndustrial Heavy Metal Contamination</h2>

            <h1>Industrial Heavy Metal Contamination</h1>
            <p id="IIpara"> The catchment area of River Yamuna in Delhi is highly urbanized and is networked with several drains. Najafgarh and Shahdara drains are the major drains that discharge a heavy load of pollutants into the river.
            
            Rapid urbanization and population growth results in industrialization pose a major threat of heavy metal pollution for nearby water bodies. The water quality monitoring of River Yamuna has indicated a significant presence of several heavy metals in its water.  </p>

    <h2> How does Delhi Contributed to Pollution</h2>
    <p>Around 90% of wastewater from households pours into the river untreated. This wastewater comprises laundry detergents and other chemicals increasing the phosphate content in the water leading to the formation of froth.
        The same goes for industrial effluents and sewage that are discharged into the river without being treated. Only 35% out of total estimated sewage discharge undergoes treatment. Other factors like idol immersion also contribute to pollution. The lead, plaster of paris (POP) and chrome paints used in making the idols also pollute the water after they are immersed. Not only this, but all the overlooked things like polythene bags, decoration items, metal polishes etc. are also a contributing factor.</p>
<h2>Delhi’s dependence on Yamuna</h2>

<p>The Delhi stretch of the Yamuna river is about 22 km starting from Wazirabad barrage to Okhla bayrage (Sharma and Kansal). This stretch alone is responsible for 76% of the rivers' pollution but this stretch is also the main source of raw water for the capital. This roughly accounts for 70% of Delhi's water supply which roughly translates to 57 million people.

    <h2> The role of ammonia</h2>
    <p>
        Recently, ammonia levels in Yamuna have risen. Over the past weekend, the ammonia levels have been fluctuating reaching upto five times above the treatable limit of 0.9ppm.
The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) which is the governing body responsible for water supply in the capital has issued an SOS.
Ammonia levels in water are harmful for the aquatic life as well. It changes the pH of water making it more alkaline. The mysterious death of fishes can also be linked to ammonia<br><BR>

    </p>
    <h2> The Yamuna Action Plan</h2>
    <p>The Yamuna Action Plan (YAP) is a river restoration project introduced in 1993. It is a bilateral project between the government of India and Japan where Japan offered loan assistance for the implementation of YAP.
        Subsequently, two phases YAP II and YAP III were initiated in 2004 and 2008 respectively.
        Unfortunately, the mission to clean Ganga and Yamuna which includes YAP has failed according to the Parliamentary Committee on Environment and Forests</p><br>
